# Cherry ULP Fork
This is a fork of pseudokus Sublimina-Contradiction Keycap repository to make the Caps compatible with the Cherry ULP Switches.
The keycaps for the Cherry ULP switches have the names `ULP_*.stl`.
The files are currently untested!
Big thanks to [microfortnight](https://github.com/microfortnight/) for help with the generation of the STLs.

# Subliminal Contradiction
Low Profile Sculpted Keycaps
![74](./Photo/1.jpg)

## Motivation
A proper next iteration on DES that's lower, flatter profile like CS, but as sculpted as DES; Shorter press distance, but wider top surface area; deeper and huggier dish, yet smoother transition between rows, and combo capability
